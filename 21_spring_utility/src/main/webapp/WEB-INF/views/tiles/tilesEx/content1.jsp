		<h2>Bridge Over Troubled Water - simon and garfunkel </h2>
		<p>
			When you're weary <br/>
			Feeling small<br/>
			When tears are in your eyes<br/>
			I'll dry them all<br/>
			I'm on your side<br/>
			Oh, when times get rough<br/>
			And friends just can't be found<br/>
			Like a bridge over troubled water<br/>
			I will lay me down<br/>
			Like a bridge over troubled water<br/>
			I will lay me down<br/>
			When you're down and out<br/>
			When you're on the street<br/>
			When evening falls so hard<br/>
			I will comfort you<br/>
			I'll take your part<br/>
			Oh, when darkness comes<br/>
			And pain is all around<br/>
