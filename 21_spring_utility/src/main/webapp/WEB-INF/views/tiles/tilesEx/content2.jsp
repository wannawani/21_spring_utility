		<h2>Wonderful Tonight - Eric Clapton</h2>
		<p>
			It's late in the evening<br/>
			She's wondering what clothes to wear<br/>
			She puts on her make up<br/>
			And brushes her long blonde hair<br/>
			And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"<br/>
			And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"<br/>
			We go to a party<br/>
			And everyone turns to see<br/>
			This beautiful lady<br/>
			That's walking around with me<br/>
			And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"<br/>
			And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"<br/>
